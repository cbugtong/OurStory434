# Installing OurStory on your mobile device
If you already know how to install an application on your device using Android Studio, then you're good to go.
Otherwise, this README contains information on how to install OurStory. 

First, install Android Studio onto your workspace (not your mobile device). Additionally, you will need a 
device that runs on Android to run this app.

Second, import the OurStory folder located on the same level of this README. You can do so by clicking the import
option under the files tab.

Third, connect your mobile device to your workspace via USB. You will need to unlock developer options. If the file
does not load for some reason, go to the Build tab in Android Studio and Clean and Build the Project.

Fourth, run the application on your device.

It's that easy! We hope you enjoy your experience with OurStory.
